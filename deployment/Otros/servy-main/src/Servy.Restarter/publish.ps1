.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes the Servy.Restarter project as a self-contained, single-file executable.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script builds the Servy.Restarter project using the interactive publish pattern
    shared with Servy.Service: [CmdletBinding()] plus a -Pause switch for manual runs.
    It publishes to the default bin directory and optionally signs the published executable
    with SignPath when -BuildConfiguration is Release and setup/signpath.ps1 is present;
    otherwise signing is skipped with a warning.

.PARAMETER Tfm
    Target framework to build against. Default is "net10.0-windows".

.PARAMETER Runtime
    Runtime identifier (RID) for the published executable. Default is "win-x64".

.PARAMETER BuildConfiguration
    Build configuration (e.g., Release or Debug). Default is "Release".

.PARAMETER Pause
    If specified, pauses the script at the end for review.
