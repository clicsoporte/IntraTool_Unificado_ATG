.SYNOPSIS
    Builds and publishes the Servy.CLI application (Release, self-contained) and
    optionally signs the output executable using SignPath.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs the following steps:
      1. Runs the resource publishing script (publish-res-debug.ps1 or publish-res-release.ps1, selected by -BuildConfiguration).
      2. Builds and publishes Servy.CLI as a self-contained, single-file executable
         for the specified target framework and runtime.
      3. Signs the published executable with SignPath when -BuildConfiguration is Release
         and setup/signpath.ps1 is present; otherwise signing is skipped with a warning.

    This is used as part of the Release build pipeline to produce final CLI artifacts.

.PARAMETER Tfm
    Target Framework Moniker to publish for.
    Default: net10.0-windows.

.PARAMETER BuildConfiguration
    Build configuration to use.
    Default: Release.

.PARAMETER Runtime
    Target runtime identifier (RID) for publishing.
    Default: win-x64.

.EXAMPLE
    ./publish.ps1
    Publishes the CLI using the defaults (Release, net10.0-windows, win-x64).

.EXAMPLE
    ./publish.ps1 -Runtime win-arm64
    Publishes the CLI for the ARM64 runtime.
