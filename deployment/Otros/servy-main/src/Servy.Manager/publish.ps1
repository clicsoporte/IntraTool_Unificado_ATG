.SYNOPSIS
    Self-contained build and publish script for Servy.Manager.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs the following steps:
      1. Runs the resource publishing step via publish-res-<configuration>.ps1
      (publish-res-debug.ps1 / publish-res-release.ps1, selected by -BuildConfiguration).
      2. Builds and publishes the Servy.Manager project as a
         self-contained, single-file executable for the specified
         target framework and runtime.
      3. Signs the published executable with SignPath when -BuildConfiguration is Release
         and setup/signpath.ps1 is present; otherwise signing is skipped with a warning.

.PARAMETER Tfm
    Target framework for the build.
    Default: net10.0-windows.

.PARAMETER BuildConfiguration
    Build configuration to use.
    Default: Release.

.PARAMETER Runtime
    Target runtime identifier (RID) for publishing.
    Default: win-x64.

.EXAMPLE
    .\publish.ps1
    Builds Servy.Manager in Release mode with default settings.

.EXAMPLE
    .\publish.ps1 -Tfm "net10.0-windows" -BuildConfiguration "Debug" -Runtime "win-x64"
    Builds Servy.Manager for an explicit target framework, configuration and runtime.
