# Servy

Servy lets you run any app as a native Windows service with full control over the working directory, startup type, process priority, CPU affinity, logging, health checks, environment variables, dependencies, pre-launch and post-launch hooks, pre-stop and post-stop hooks, and parameters.

Servy is digitally signed with a code-signing certificate provided by the SignPath Foundation. The signature verifies the publisher, enables Windows to detect any modification of the released binaries and installers, and prevents SmartScreen warnings.

Servy offers a desktop app, a CLI, and a PowerShell module that let you create, configure, and manage Windows services interactively or through scripts and CI/CD pipelines. It also includes a Manager app for monitoring and managing all installed services in real time.

Servy continuously monitors your app, restarting it automatically if it crashes, hangs, or stops. It is well suited to keeping non-service apps running in the background and ensuring they start automatically at system boot, even before logon, without rewriting them as services. Use it to run Node.js, Python, .NET, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, or Ruby applications; keep web servers, background workers, sync tools, or daemons alive after reboots; and automate task runners, schedulers, or scripts in production with built-in health checks, logging, and restart policies.

## Demo Video

This video demonstrates Servy 1.0. While Servy has evolved significantly since then with many features like real-time CPU/RAM monitoring, stdout/stderr streaming, heartbeat pings, notifications, and CPU affinity, the core concept remains the same.

## Why?

See [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) for details.

## Getting Started

Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/releases/latest) or install via a package manager:

**WinGet**

```powershell
winget install servy
```

**Chocolatey**

```powershell
choco install -y servy
```

**Scoop**

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install servy
```

**Patch My PC**

Servy is available in the official [Patch My PC catalog](https://patchmypc.com/supported-products/) for enterprise automated deployment and updates via Microsoft Intune and ConfigMgr (SCCM).

> [!NOTE]
> **Legacy OS Support (Windows 7 SP1 / 8.x / Server 2008 R2):** Package managers carry the self-contained modern build. For older platforms, download `servy-x.x-net48-x64-installer.exe` or `servy-x.x-net48-x64-portable.7z` directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/releases/latest) (requires .NET Framework 4.8).

## Quick Example

You can manage services using the [desktop app (GUI)](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/wiki/Servy-Desktop-App), the [CLI](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/wiki/Servy-CLI), or [PowerShell](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/wiki/Servy-PowerShell-Module).

Here's a minimal example using the CLI to run a Node.js app as a Windows service. Run it from an elevated PowerShell prompt: installing, starting and stopping a Windows service all require administrator privileges.

```powershell
servy-cli install `
  --name="MyService" `
  --path="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" `
  --startupDir="C:\MyServer" `
  --params="server.js" `
  --enableHealth
```

This creates a service named `MyService` that runs your Node.js server in the background, starts automatically with Windows, and has [health monitoring](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/wiki/Health-Monitoring-&-Recovery) enabled.

Then start the service:

```powershell
servy-cli start --name="MyService"
```

Or from an **elevated** Command Prompt:

```cmd
sc.exe start MyService
```
